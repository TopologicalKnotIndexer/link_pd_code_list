Academic tradition requires you to cite works you base your article on.
If you use programs that use GNU Parallel to process data for an article in a
scientific publication, please cite:

@software{tange_2025_15265748,
      author       = {Tange, Ole},
      title        = {GNU Parallel 20250422 ('Tariffs')},
      month        = Apr,
      year         = 2025,
      note         = {{GNU Parallel is a general parallelizer to run
                       multiple serial command line programs in parallel
                       without changing them.}},
      publisher    = {Zenodo},
      doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.15265748},
      url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15265748}
}

This helps funding further development; AND IT WON'T COST YOU A CENT.
If you pay 10000 EUR you should feel free to use GNU Parallel without citing.
