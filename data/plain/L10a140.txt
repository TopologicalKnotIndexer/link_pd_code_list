Brunnian	link.	Presumably	the	simplest	
Brunnian	link
	other	than	the	Borromean	rings.

	The	second	in	an	infinite	series	of	Brunnian	links	--	if	the	blue	and	yellow	loops	in	the
illustration	below	have	only	one	twist	along	each	side,	the	result	is	the	Borromean	rings;	if	the	blue	and	yellow	loops	have	three	twists	along	each
side,	the	result	is	this	L10a140	link;	if	the	blue	and	yellow	loops	have	five	twists	along	each	side,	the	result	is	a	three-loop	link	with	14	overall
crossings,	etc.
