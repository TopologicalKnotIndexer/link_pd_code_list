L4a1
	is	
	in	the	Rolfsen	table	of	links.	It
frequently	occurs	in	late	Roman	mosaics	and	some	medieval
decorations.	
In	this	context,	it	is	called	the	"Solomon's	knot"	(sigillum
Salomonis)	or	"guilloche	knot".	
It	is	also	the	"Kramo-bone"	symbol
(meaning	"one	being	bad	makes	all	appear	to	be	bad")	of	the	Adinkra
symbol	system.	Link	
L10a101
